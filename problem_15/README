The files index.php and demo/page.php was modified, check the comments on this files, the steps to
hack the system are:
    - Create a function to using brute force creacks the random generated key, you can see the code
      commented on the  method saveGame of the demo/page.php class, this action compares the known
      signature who cames from the server with the random generated signatures until found the correct
      one and the secret with it
    - With the secret used by the server create a spoofed cookie
    - Modify the path to the file with the version whom content is returned on the "X-Tuenti-Powered-By"
    - Parse the header to get the cookie content, and.... That's all :)
